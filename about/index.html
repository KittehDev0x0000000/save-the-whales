    <h3>Our Goal</h3>
    <p>To guide you on how to do your part to save the whales.</p>
    <h3>The Plan</h3>
    <p>Creating a database with easy to access info on what YOU can do.</p>
    <h3>Our accomplishments</h3>
    <p>Creating this page and spreading awareness of Whaling, its affects on the environment AND the world.</p>
    <h3>Who are we?</h3>
    <p>We are students at NYCDA working on this collabrative project.</p>
    <p>This page was founded in Early 2018 and plans to keep updated on newly posted sites or ways to help.
    You don't need to know much about whales, we are here to share knowledge on what you can do with what resources you have.</p>
