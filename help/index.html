    <h1>Why We Need Your Help:</h1>
    <p>Whales are facing major obstacles in oceans around the globe. Every day whale populations are affected by climate change, pollution, human-created noise in the ocean, and overfishing. You can help save whales by supporting the efforts of conservation organizations that are working to stop harmful practices that affect whales. You can also take direct action by contacting your government representatives and urging them to support whale conservation efforts.</p>
    <h2>Ways You Can Help:</h2>
    <li>Contact the International Whaling Commission</li>
    <li>Speak out Against Seismic and Sonar Testing</li>
    <li>Create or Sign a Petition Against Whaling</li>
    <li>Literally get signed up to Fight a Whale Hunter</li>
    <h3>You Can Adopt Your Very Own Whale Here's How:</h3>
    <p>Some organizations allow individuals to make a symbolic whale adoption. For a donation to the organization, you can symbolically adopt a whale while donating cash to the cause. Many organizations will give you a personalized adoption certificate commemorating your adoption.</p>
    <p>Try adopting a whale through an organization like Defenders of Wildlife.</p>
    <li>As a disclaimer we do not recommend housing a whale at your home residence or local body of water. This is highly illegal and would result in possible arrest or fines</li>
